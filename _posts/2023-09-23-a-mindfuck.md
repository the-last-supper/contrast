This reality construct never fail to amaze me. Just when I think, “I figured it out”, WHAM! It hits me with a deeper level of mind-boggling complexity.

In this life, I was born an advisor. This is my soul’s contract, an agreement made and signed before my birth. Essentially, it means that people come to me for guidance.

Being an advisor means various things, but this sums it up: my success depends on my ability to play this game from an objective perspective and provide advice to those seeking my guidance. I am a non-energy type, primarily observing life from a third-person perspective.

I will not bore you with what it means to be a non-energy type. There is enough knowledge constructed and propagated out there, study it if you’d like.

The mind-boggler for me has been this: 
As a human, in flesh and bone, I eat, sleep, seek safety, emote, and feel pain. 
I lose and I gain, 
Emerging from my mother’s womb, knowing one day it all shall wane, 
I am a first-person player, and so are we all, in this reality construct.

I had to learn this the hard way. I’m no saint, no fairy, not from another realm—I’m just another human with a strategy. Putting my ego aside to advise others is simply a strategy, one that promises success—both mine and those who seek my guidance.

Now that all delusions vanished, for the rest of my incarnation, perhaps in my next, hereby I present a note to self: Mind-fuck.
