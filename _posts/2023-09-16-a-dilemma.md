After a breakthrough, there’s always a dilemma. What’s next? There is always another obstacle to overcome.
>The great thing about ‘7 days to live’ is that there will be ‘7 more days to live’ if you make it through.

I like living this way, or simply seeing reality for what it is.



#### What are you truly worth?

When shit hits then fan, you will know what you are worth, not to yourself, but to the WORLD. 

To your fellas, to your ladies.
To your friends, to your enemies.
To your your neighbours, communities and the powers that be.
To the final boss, that is humanity.

#### When shit hits the fan, true colours show.

When you are down, they will suck you dry.
Down to your last penny.
Down to your last piece of cloth.
Down to your last bit of data.

#### We are hungry, for POWER.

Power exists in many forms.

##### Mission one was called MONEY.

A wise man once told me: “If you want to be rich, work for the banks”.

##### Mission two is called INFORMATION.
When you hold the information, you hold power.
People will come for power.
They will also stab you in the back, sell you out for a buck.
